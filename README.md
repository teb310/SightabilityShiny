# SightabilityModels
Elk sightability factor - South Coast Region

This folder holds the information you'll need to run a Sightability Model on annual elk survey data. First, read the "How to Run Sightability Model...docx" to understand what data you need and how to format it.

Example input data and associated outputs are available in their respective folders. The scripts were based on Feiberg (2013) data and scripts, which are available for reference in the 'Feiberg' folder.

Please be sure to copy this folder onto your C:/ drive before attempting to work with the data and scripts.
