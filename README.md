# SightabilityShiny
Elk abundance estimator app - South Coast Region

This repo stores the code that runs the Roosevelt Elk Abundance Estimator app (https://3ahyqy-tristen-brush.shinyapps.io/ElkAbundanceEstimator/). To run the sightability model outside of the app, please see my SightabilityModel repo.

The models and scripts are based on Feiberg (2013), whose data are available for reference in the 'Feiberg' folder.

Please be sure to copy this folder onto your C:/ drive before attempting to work with the data and scripts.
